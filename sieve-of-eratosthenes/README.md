# Prime Number Calculator

This repository contains a PHP script that calculates prime numbers up to a specified limit. The code was created by myself, Wil K Edwards, as a practice exercise.

## Usage

To use the prime number calculator, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have PHP installed on your system.
2. Clone or download this repository.
3. Open the PHP file (`prime_numbers.php`) in a text editor.
4. Modify the `$n` variable to set the desired limit for prime number calculation.
5. Save the file.

To execute the script, open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the PHP file is located. Then, run the following command:

```bash
php prime_numbers.php

The script will calculate and display the prime numbers up to the specified limit.

## Example

If you want to calculate prime numbers up to 1000, modify the script as follows:

```php
$n = 1000; // Set the limit to 1000

Save the file and execute it using the command mentioned above. The script will output the prime numbers up to 1000.
