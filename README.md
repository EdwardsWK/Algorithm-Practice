# Overview

This repository contains two scripts created by myself, [Wil K Edwards](https://github.com/EdwardsWK), as practice exercises to enhance my skills and understanding in programming algorithms. The scripts are as follows:

## Prime Number Calculator

The "Prime Number Calculator" script is a PHP program that calculates prime numbers up to a specified limit.
It utilises the 'Sieve of Erathosthenes' algorithm

## FizzBuzz

The "FizzBuzz" script provides solutions to the FizzBuzz problem in multiple programming languages.

### Please refer to the individual subdirectories for detailed information and usage instructions for each script.
