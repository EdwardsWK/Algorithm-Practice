# Fizz Buzz

This repository contains my solution to the FizzBuzz problem in multiple programming languages.
The goal of the FizzBuzz problem is to write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100, but for multiples of three print "Fizz" instead of the number and for the multiples of five print "Buzz". For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print "FizzBuzz".


## Languages Included

- Java
- PHP
- Python
- Scala


## How to Run

Each implementation can be run using the appropriate interpreter or compiler for the language.

- Java: use `javac` command to compile the code and then `java` command to execute the class file.
- PHP: use `php` command to run the code.
- Python: use `python` command to run the code.
- Scala: use `scalac` command to compile the code and then `scala` command to execute the class file.
