# FizzBuzz

This repository contains my solution to the FizzBuzz problem in multiple programming languages.  
The goal of the FizzBuzz problem is to write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100, but for multiples of three print "Fizz" instead of the number and for the multiples of five print "Buzz". For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print "FizzBuzz".

## Usage

To use the FizzBuzz script, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have PHP installed on your system.
2. Clone or download this repository.
3. Open the PHP file (`fizzbuzz.php`) in a text editor.
4. Save the file.
5. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the PHP file is located.
6. Run the command `php fizzbuzz.php`.
7. The script will print the numbers from 1 to 100, following the FizzBuzz rules.

## Example Output
'''bash
